# 3DMive
Welcome to 3DMive

3DMive is a project I started about a year(I wrote this in 20150217) and a couple of months ago, but took about 8 months off to work on other things. Due to this fact I've decided to make this project open source. and have as many people help me and share the knowledge.

So, what is 3DMive?, 3DMive stands for 3D Model importer-viewer-exporter(sometimes editor), take in consideration this is a working title.

My goal(dream?) is for people to start thinking of 3DMive as THE STANDARD multiplatform application used to view ANY 3D model from any 3D modeling/sculpting software like ZBRush, Blender, 3DCoat, and so on.

As of Feb 2015 I'm the only contributor and it will most likely stay that way until I get rid of D2D and DirectWrite dependencies. From then on, I will creat a website, the appropriate readme files, and many other things like cmake implementation, and start promoting the project so anybody that wants to work on it/improve it, will be able to at will.
